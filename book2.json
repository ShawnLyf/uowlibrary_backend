{"title": "Choice Theory : A New Psychology of Personal Freedom", "description": ["\n\n                            Glasser has worked with choice theory for half of his 40 years of psychiatric practice. Basically, choice theory helps its users avoid confrontation and ask pertinent questions. It sees conscious or unconscious desire for external control as the main problem in the four major personal relationships: husband-wife, parent-child, teacher-student, and manager-worker. If you think you can control others, it counsels, you are in for trouble, for the only person you can control is yourself. So all personal problems are both present problems and relationship problems. Glasser urges anyone in a relationship to ask, before taking a step, whether that step will keep the two related persons at least as close together as they are now; if it will, it may be worth taking. Combining choice theory and reality therapy in his practice, Glasser has been able to shorten the durations of his treatment programs substantially. As he presents them here, his theories and approaches can be applied in education and business as well as for self-help.", "\n                            ", "show more", "\n                        "], "author": "William Glasser", "rating": "\n                4.04 out of 5 stars", "publishDate": "06 Sep 2007", "pagesFormat": "368 pages\n", "image_urls": ["https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/0609/9780060930141.jpg"]},

{"title": "Multipliers, Revised and Updated : How the Best Leaders Make Everyone Smart", "description": ["\n\n                            A revised and updated edition of the acclaimed Wall Street Journal bestseller that explores why some leaders drain capability and intelligence from their teams while others amplify it to produce better results.  We've all had experience with two dramatically different types of leaders. The first type drains intelligence, energy, and capability from the people around them and always needs to be the smartest person in the room. These are the idea killers, the energy sappers, the diminishers of talent and commitment. On the other side of the spectrum are leaders who use their intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities of the people around them. When these leaders walk into a room, light bulbs go off over people's heads; ideas flow and problems get solved. These are the leaders who inspire employees to stretch themselves to deliver results that surpass expectations. These are the Multipliers. And the world needs more of them, especially now when leaders are expected to do more with less.", "\n                            In this engaging and highly practical book, leadership expert Liz Wiseman explores these two leadership styles, persuasively showing how Multipliers can have a resoundingly positive and profitable effect on organizations-getting more done with fewer resources, developing and attracting talent, and cultivating new ideas and energy to drive organizational change and innovation. In analyzing data from more than 150 leaders, Wiseman has identified five disciplines that distinguish Multipliers from Diminishers. These five disciplines are not based on innate talent; indeed, they are skills and practices that everyone can learn to use-even lifelong and recalcitrant Diminishers. Lively, real-world case studies and practical tips and techniques bring to life each of these principles, showing you how to become a Multiplier too, whether you are a new or an experienced manager. This revered classic has been updated with new examples of Multipliers, as well as two new chapters one on accidental Diminishers, and one on how to deal with Diminishers.  Just imagine what you could accomplish if you could harness all the energy and intelligence around you. Multipliers will show you how.", "\n                            ", "show more", "\n                        "], "author": "Liz Wiseman", "rating": "\n                3.98 out of 5 stars", "publishDate": "25 Jun 2018", "pagesFormat": "384 pages\n", "image_urls": ["https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/mid/9780/0626/9780062699176.jpg"]},

Do you face some situations with fear and trepidation? Do feelings of self-doubt consume everyday activities? Leading Consultant Psychiatrist, Dr Steve Peters, knows more than anyone how impulsive behaviour or nagging self-doubt can impact negatively on our professional and personal lives. In this, his first book, Steve shares his phenomenally successful mind management programme that has been used to help elite athletes and senior managers alike to conquer their fears and operate with greater control, focus and confidence. Seemingly complex concepts are made simple with the use of memorable analogies - such as the \\'chimp\\', that seemingly irrational and impulsive being that inhabits our minds - and real-life case studies. Never before will you have had such a deep and clear understanding of your own behaviour and natural responses to certain people or situations. This knowledge, combined with simple techniques that can be easily incorporated into daily life, will help you to control your emotional impulses and reach your full potential, leading to success at work and a happier, harmonious home life.", "\n                            ", "show more", "\n                        "], "author": "Steve Peters", "rating": "\n                3.99 out of 5 stars", "image_urls": ["https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9780/0919/9780091935580.jpg"]},

Hans Janssen's remarkable book provides a long overdue, in-depth and compelling account of the life of perhaps the most influential abstract artist of the 20th century. Janssen, former chief curator at the Kunstmuseum Den Haag - home to the world's largest collection of Mondrian works - draws on his own research and that of a cohort of distinguished scholars, as well as previously unknown letters, writings and archival materials, to reveal unexpected new insights into the artist's life and the circles in which he moved. From his student years in Amsterdam to his life in Paris in the years after the First World War, to his time in London and New York from 1938 until his death, Mondrian is here presented as someone in constant interaction with the world around him. Far from the lonely, isolated figure he is often portrayed as, immersing himself in the purity of abstraction to mask his feelings, Mondrian is revealed as an artist reacting to the emergence of modernity and who took the lead in shaping art for the world in which we now live. Translated into English on the 150th anniversary year of the artist's birth, Piet Mondrian: A Life is a vital contribution to the scholarship on Mondrian as well as the wider history of the development of abstract art.", "\n                            ", "show more", "\n                        "], "author": "Hans Janssen", "publishDate": "27 Sep 2022", "pagesFormat": "464 pages\n", "image_urls": ["https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/9099/9781909932517.jpg"]},

{"title": "Complex PTSD : From Surviving to Thriving: A GUIDE AND MAP FOR RECOVERING FROM CHILDHOOD TRAUMA", "description": ["\n\n                            I have Complex PTSD [Cptsd] and wrote this book from the perspective of someone who has experienced a great reduction of symptoms over the years. I also wrote it from the viewpoint of someone who has discovered many silver linings in the long, windy, bumpy road of recovering from Cptsd. I felt encouraged to write this book because of thousands of e-mail responses to the articles on my website that repeatedly expressed gratitude for the helpfulness of my work. An often echoed comment sounded like this: At last someone gets it. I can see now that I am not bad, defective or crazy...or alone! The causes of Cptsd range from severe neglect to monstrous abuse. Many survivors grow up in houses that are not homes - in families that are as loveless as orphanages and sometimes as dangerous. If you felt unwanted, unliked, rejected, hated and/or despised for a lengthy portion of your childhood, trauma may be deeply engrained in your mind, soul and body. This book is a practical, user-friendly self-help guide to recovering from the lingering effects of childhood trauma, and to achieving a rich and fulfilling life. It is copiously illustrated with examples of my own and my clients' journeys of recovering. This book is also for those who do not have Cptsd but want to understand and help a loved one who does. This book also contains an overview of the tasks of recovering and a great many practical tools and techniques for recovering from childhood trauma. It extensively elaborates on all the recovery concepts explained on my website, and many more. However, unlike the articles on my website, it is oriented toward the layperson. As such, much of the psychological jargon and dense concentration of concepts in the website articles has been replaced with expanded and easier to follow explanations. Moreover, many principles that were only sketched out in the articles are explained in much greater detail. A great deal of new material is also explored. Key concepts of the book include managing emotional flashbacks, understanding the four different types of trauma survivors, differentiating the outer critic from the inner critic, healing the abandonment depression that come from emotional abandonment and self-abandonment, self-reparenting and reparenting by committee, and deconstructing the hierarchy of self-injuring responses that childhood trauma forces survivors to adopt. The book also functions as a map to help you understand the somewhat linear progression of recovery, to help you identify what you have already accomplished, and to help you figure out what is best to work on and prioritize now. This in turn also serves to help you identify the signs of your recovery and to develop reasonable expectations about the rate of your recovery. I hope this map will guide you to heal in a way that helps you to become an unflinching source of kindness and self-compassion for yourself, and that out of that journey you will find at least one other human being who will reciprocally love you well enough in that way.", "\n                            ", "show more", "\n                        "], "author": "Pete Walker", "rating": "\n                4.58 out of 5 stars", "publishDate": "13 Dec 2013", "pagesFormat": "376 pages\n", "image_urls": ["https://d1w7fb2mkkr3kw.cloudfront.net/assets/images/book/lrg/9781/4928/9781492871842.jpg"]},

His was the government to decriminalise homosexuality, legalise abortion and abolish capital punishment.

Alone and rudderless in New York, he is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. He is tormented by an unbearable longing for his mother, and down the years clings to the thing that most reminds him of her: a small, strangely captivating painting that ultimately draws him into the criminal underworld.

For the 7th book in the much-lauded Remembering Wildlife series, the organizers have chosen for the first time to leave Africa and to feature bears. There are eight species of bear: American black bears, Andean bears, Asiatic black bears, brown bears, giant pandas, polar bears, sloth bears and sun bears. There are fascinating differences between them, which have implications for their behavior, evolution and conservation. Their habitats range from forests to woodland, grasslands to sea ice and their behaviors reflect that too. From climbing to swimming, fishing to hibernation, their differences are intriguing and captivating and through stunning imagery this book will show that and also bring attention to the threats they face. Like all of the species we've previously featured in our series, the challenges bears face are all sadly, once again man-made. From climate change to habitat loss; and from hunting to the illegal trade in body parts, including the Asiatic bear bile trade, our impact threatens their very future on this planet.

As the pages unfold, you can join with the Apprentice Alchemist and be invited 'inside the images', greeted by the animate sun who explains their origin, symbols and patterns, and offers guided reveries into the 'chapel of the heart' and 'court of the philosophers', from which to meet the Splendor Solis Tarot Artisans, Ambassadors and Awakeners.
